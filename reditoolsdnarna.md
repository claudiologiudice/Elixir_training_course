<p align="justify"> Epitranscriptome refers to all biochemical RNA modifications affecting cellular RNAs. 
Nowadays, RNAseq is the de facto standard approach to discover RNA editing candidates in whole
eukaryotic genomes 10,15 . Although the identiÔ¨Åcation of editing sites is, in principle, quite simple, it
represents a computational challenge because true RNA editing events have to be discriminated from
genome-encoded single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and technical artefacts caused by
