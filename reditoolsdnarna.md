<p align="justify"> Epitranscriptome refers to all biochemical RNA modifications affecting cellular RNAs. 
Nowadays, RNAseq is the de facto standard approach to discover RNA editing candidates in whole
eukaryotic genomes 10,15 . Although the identiﬁcation of editing sites is, in principle, quite simple, it
represents a computational challenge because true RNA editing events have to be discriminated from
genome-encoded single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and technical artefacts caused by
  sequencing or read-mapping errors 10,15–19 . The use of genomic reads from whole genome sequencing
(WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WXS) experiments in single individuals, annotations in the
database of SNPs (dbSNP) and several stringent ﬁlters can minimize the detection of false RNA
editing candidates
